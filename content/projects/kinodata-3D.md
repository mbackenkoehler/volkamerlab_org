Structural machine learning models require large datasets for training. As such datasets are unavailable, we assess the use of in-silico structural docking data for machine learning. To this end, we perform template docking on a large kinase activity dataset (kinodata). We extensively compare affinity prediction models with access to the 3D complexes to various baseline models without access to this structure. We observe an increased performance of the model trained on the docked complexes.
